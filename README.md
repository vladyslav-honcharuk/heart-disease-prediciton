# Heart Disease Prediciton

Predicting heart disease likelihood using different ML algorithms

The main goal of the project is to predict whether patient has low or high likelihood of heard disease
occurance. As a dataset I have used the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, which
comes from a study conducted in 1988 and originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
